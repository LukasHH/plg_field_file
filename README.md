<h3>JCE Settings</h3>
<p>If you have installed the JCE Editor, then note the configuration for this. The default setting is that the file browser of the JCE should be used instead of the Media Manager from the Core.</p>
<p>However, the JCE file browser ignores the settings, which is why this should be switched off in the configuration.</p>
